In my final version, I have slightly deviated from the original plan by removing some redundant tables and linking each substance to an array of effects stored in the substances table. 
This is makes far more sense than having a general set of effects for each class of chemical as it is far more accurate.

I have also included a selection of 9 substances already in the database to demonstrate how the site works. 
Creating more, while it might make the site more full of content, is not necessary to show how the site works and would greatly increase the time spent on adding content.
