(1, 'Analysis enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Analysis enhancement is a perceived improvement of a person\'s overall ability to logically process information or creatively analyze concepts, ideas, and scenarios. This effect can lead to a deep state of contemplation which often results in an abundance of new and insightful ideas. It can give the person a perceived ability to better analyze concepts and problems in a manner which allows them to reach new conclusions, perspectives, and solutions which would have been otherwise difficult to conceive of.'),
(2, 'Anxiety', 'Cognitive', 'Anxiety is the experience of negative feelings of apprehension, worry, and general unease. These feelings can range from subtle and ignorable to intense and overwhelming enough to trigger panic attacks or feelings of impending doom. Anxiety is often accompanied by nervous behaviour such as restlessness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and muscular tension.'),
(3, 'Creativity enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Creativity enhancement is a perceived increase in one\'s capability to imagine new ideas, create art, or think about existing concepts in a novel manner. This effect is particularly useful to artists of any sort as it can help a person overcome creative blocks on existing projects and induce inspiration for entirely new projects. Creativity enhancement can make imaginative activities more enjoyable and effortless in the moment and the inspiration from it can benefit the individual even after the effect has worn off.'),
(4, 'Dream potentiation', 'Cognitive', 'Dream potentiation is an effect which increases the subjective intensity, vividness, and frequency of sleeping dream states. This effect also results in dreams having a more complex and incohesive plot with a higher level of detail and definition. Additionally, the effect causes a greatly increased likelihood of them becoming lucid dreams.'),
(5, 'Ego inflation', 'Cognitive', 'Ego inflation is an effect that magnifies and enhances one\'s own ego and self-regard in a manner which results in feeling an increased sense of confidence, superiority, and general arrogance.'),
(6, 'Emotion enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Emotion enhancement is an effect which greatly amplifies and enhances a person\'s current emotional state beyond normal levels of intensity.'),
(7, 'Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement is the experience of a mind state which is dominated by intense feelings of compassion, talkativeness, and happiness. The experience of this effect creates a wide range of subjective changes to a person\'s perception of their feelings towards other people and themselves.'),
(8, 'Focus enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Focus enhancement is the experience of an increased ability to selectively concentrate on an aspect of the environment while ignoring other things. It can be best characterized by feelings of intense concentration which can allow one to continuously focus on and perform tasks which would otherwise be considered too monotonous, boring, or dull to not get distracted from.'),
(9, 'Immersion enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Immersion enhancement is an effect which results in a pronounced increase in one\'s tendency to become fully captivated and engrossed by external stimuli such as film, TV shows, video games, and various other forms of media.'),
(10, 'Increased music appreciation', 'Cognitive', 'Increased music appreciation is a general sense of an increased enjoyment of music. When music is listened to during this state, not only does it subjectively sound better, but the perceived music and lyrical content may have a profound impact on the listener.'),
(11, 'Increased sense of humor', 'Cognitive', 'Increased sense of humor is a general enhancement of the likelihood and degree to which a person finds stimuli to be humorous and amusing. During this state, a person\'s sensitivity to finding things funny is noticeably amplified, often to the point that they will begin uncontrollably laughing at trivial things without any intelligible reason or apparent cause.'),
(12, 'Irritability', 'Cognitive', 'Irritability is the pervasive and sustained emotional state of being easily annoyed and provoked to '),
(13, 'Memory enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Memory enhancement is an improvement in a person\'s ability to recall or retain memories. The experience of this effect can make it easier for a person to access and remember past memories at a greater level of detail when compared to that of everyday sober living. It can also help one retain new information that may then be more easily recalled once the person is no longer under the influence of the psychoactive substance.'),
(14, 'Motivation enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Motivation enhancement is an increased desire to perform tasks and accomplish goals in a productive manner.This includes tasks and goals that would normally be considered too monotonous or overwhelming to fully commit oneself to.'),
(15, 'Novelty enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Novelty enhancement is a feeling of increased fascination, awe, and appreciation attributed to specific parts or the entirety of one\'s external environment. This can result in an often overwhelming impression that everyday concepts such as nature, existence, common events, and even household objects are now considerably more profound, interesting, and significant.'),
(16, 'Personal meaning enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Personal meaning enhancement (also known as aberrant salience) is the experience of a considerably increased sense of personal significance becoming attributed to innocuous situations, and coincidences. Trivial observations not usually noticed may seem connected, and a subjective state of \"seeing solutions\" might evolve to one of seeing problems, ultimately arriving at a full-fledged paranoid psychosis.'),
(17, 'Suggestibility enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Suggestibility enhancement is an increased tendency to accept and act on the ideas or attitudes of others. A common example of suggestibility enhancement in action would be a trip sitter deliberately making a person believe a false statement without question simply by telling it to them as true, even if the statement would usually be easily recognizable as impossible or absurd. If this is successfully accomplished, it can potentially result in the experience of relevant accompanying hallucinations and delusions which further solidify the belief which has been suggested to them.'),
(18, 'Thought acceleration', 'Cognitive', 'Thought acceleration (also known as racing thoughts) is the experience of thought processes being sped up significantly in comparison to that of everyday sobriety. When experiencing this effect, it will often feel as if one rapid-fire thought after the other is being generated in incredibly quick succession. Thoughts while undergoing this effect are not necessarily qualitatively different, but greater in their volume and speed. However, they are commonly associated with a change in mood that can be either positive or negative.'),
(19, 'Thought connectivity', 'Cognitive', 'Thought connectivity is an alteration of a person\'s thought stream which is characterized by a distinct increase in unconstrained wandering thoughts which connect into each other through a fluid association of ideas.'),
(20, 'Thought organization', 'Cognitive', 'Thought organization (also known as fluid intelligence) is a state of mind in which one\'s abili'),
(21, 'Wakefulness', 'Cognitive', 'Wakefulness is an increased ability to stay conscious without feeling sleepy combined with a decreased need to sleep. It is contrasted with stimulation in that it does not directly increase one\'s energy levels above a normal baseline but instead produces feelings of a wakeful, well-rested, and alert state. If one is sleepy before using this substance, the impulse to sleep will fade, keeping one?s eyes open will become easier, and the cognitive fog of exhaustion will be reduced. However, sufficiently accumulated sleep deficiency can overpower or negate this effect in extreme cases.'),
(22, 'Amnesia', 'Cognitive', 'Amnesia is a global impairment in the ability to acquire new memories regardless of sensory modality, and a loss of some memories, especially recent ones, from the period before amnesia began. During states of amnesia a person will usually retain functional perceptual abilities and short-term memory which can still be used to recall events that recently occurred; this effect is distinct from the memory impairment produced by sedation. As such, a person experiencing amnesia may not obviously appear to be doing so, as they can often carry on normal conversations and perform complex tasks.'),
(23, 'Analysis suppression', 'Cognitive', 'Analysis suppression is a distinct decrease in a person\'s overall ability to process information and logically or creatively analyze concepts, ideas, and scenarios. The experience of this effect leads to significant difficulty contemplating or understanding basic ideas in a manner which can temporarily prevent normal cognitive functioning.'),
(24, 'Anxiety suppression', 'Cognitive', 'Anxiety suppression (also known as anxiolysis or minimal sedation) is a partial to complete suppression of a person?s ability to feel anxiety, general unease, and negative feelings of both psychological and physiological tension.The experience of this effect may decrease anxiety-related behaviours such as restlessness, muscular tension,rumination, and panic attacks. This typically results in feelings of extreme calmness and relaxation.'),
(25, 'Cognitive fatigue', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive fatigue (also called exhaustion, tiredness, lethargy, languidness, languor, lassitude, and listlessness) is a state usually associated with a weakening or depletion of one\'s mental resources. The intensity and duration of this effect typically depends on the substance consumed and its dosage. It can also be further exacerbated by various factors such as a lack of sleep or food.'),
(27, 'Creativity suppression', 'Cognitive', 'Creativity suppression is a decrease in both a person\'s motivation and capabilities when performing tasks that involve producing artistic output or novel problem-solving. This effect may be particularly frustrating to deal with for artists of any sort as it will induce a temporary creative block.'),
(28, 'Delirium', 'Cognitive', 'Delirium (also known as acute confusion) is a physiological disturbance of awareness that is accompanied by a change in baseline cognition which cannot be better explained by a preexisting or evolving neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance in awareness is manifested by a reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention and the accompanying cognitive change in at least one other area may include memory and learning (particularly recent memory), disorientation (particularly to time and place), alteration in language, or perceptual distortions or a perceptual-motor disturbance.'),
(29, 'Disinhibition', 'Cognitive', 'Disinhibition is an orientation towards immediate gratification, leading to impulsive behavior driven by current thoughts, feelings, and external stimuli, without regard for past learning or consideration of future consequences.'),
(30, 'Dizziness', 'Physical', 'Dizziness can be described as the perception of a spinning or swaying motion which typically causes a difficulty in standing or walking. It is commonly associated with a loss of balance and feelings of lightheadedness. Dizziness is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as nausea and motor control loss. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of GABAergic depressant compounds, such as benzodiazepines, alcohol, and GHB. However, it can also occur to a lesser extent under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelics, dissociatives, and cannabinoids.'),
(31, 'Headache', 'Physical', 'A headache can be described as a pain anywhere in the region of the head or neck. It can be a symptom of a number of different conditions. This occurs in migraines (sharp, or throbbing pains), tension-type headaches, and cluster headaches. It is worth noting that due to its lacks of pain receptors, headaches are not caused by pain within the brain tissue itself, instead, headaches are caused by disturbances of the pain-sensitive structures around the brain. '),
(32, 'Motor control loss', 'Physical', 'Motor control loss can be described as feeling as if there has been a distinct decrease in a person\'s ability to control their physical body with precision, balance, coordination, and dexterity.'),
(33, 'Perception of bodily lightness', 'Physical', 'Perception of bodily lightness can be described as feeling as if one\'s body has significantly decreased in its weight. This can result in feelings of increased energy and a general sense of bounciness due to the body seeming weightless and therefore effortless to move.'),
(34, 'Physical euphoria', 'Physical', 'Physical euphoria can be described as feelings of pleasure and comfort within and across the body. This euphoria typically feels somewhat comparable to the endorphine rushes felt during states of excitement or love, the coziness of a comfortable bed, and the rush of an orgasm. The forcefulness of this effect can range from subtle in its strength to overwhelmingly pleasurable beyond even the most intense full body orgasm possible.'),
(35, 'Tactile suppression', 'Physical', 'Tactile suppression can be described as a decrease in one\'s ability to feel their sense of touch in a manner which can result in a general numbness across the body. At higher levels, this can eventually increase to the point where physical sensations have been completely blocked and the body is fully anaesthetized.'),
(36, 'Spontaneous bodily sensations', 'Physical', 'Spontaneous tactile sensations are the experience of sensations across the body occurring without any obvious or immediate physical trigger. This results in feelings of seemingly random but distinct tingling sensations that occur across the skin and within the body. Depending on the psychoactive substance consumed, these vary greatly in their styles of sensation.'),
(37, 'Changes in felt bodily form', 'Physical', 'Changes in felt bodily form can be described as feelings of the body shifting in its perceived physical shape, organization and form in a manner which is typically devoid of accompanying visual alterations. For example, feelings of the body folding into itself many times over, stretching, splitting into separate parts, expanding, or condensing into, over, and across itself in extremely complex forms are all entirely possible. It is worth noting that although this effect is usually perfectly comfortable to undergo, it can sometimes be somewhat uncomfortable under certain circumstances.'),
(38, 'Compulsive redosing', 'Cognitive', 'Compulsive redosing is the experience of a powerful and difficult to resist urge to continuously redose a psychoactive substance in an effort to increase or maintain the subjective effects which it induces.'),
(39, 'Depersonalization', 'Cognitive', 'Depersonalization or depersonalisation (sometimes abbreviated as DP) is the experience of feeling detached from, and as if one is an outside observer of, one\'s mental processes, body, or actions. (e.g., feeling like one is in a dream; a sense of unreality of self, perceptual alterations; emotional and/or physical numbing; temporal distortions; sense of unreality). During this state, the affected person may feel that they are \"on autopilot\" and that the world has become vague, dreamlike, less real, or lacking in significance. Individuals who experience depersonalization often feel divorced from their own personal physicality by no longer sensing their body sensations, feelings, emotions, and behaviors as belonging to a person or identity.'),
(40, 'Cognitive euphoria', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive euphoria (semantically the opposite of cognitive dysphoria) is medically recognized as a cognitive and emotional state in which a person experiences intense feelings of well-being, elation, happiness, excitement, and joy.Although euphoria is an effect (i.e. a substance is euphorigenic), the term is also used colloquially to define a state of transcendent happiness combined with an intense sense of contentment. However, recent psychological research suggests euphoria can largely contribute to but should not be equated with happiness.'),
(41, 'Memory suppression', 'Cognitive', 'Memory suppression (also known as ego suppression, ego loss or ego death) is an inhibition of a person\'s ability to maintain a functional short and long-term memory. This occurs in a manner that is directly proportional to the dosage consumed, and often begins with the degradation of one\'s short-term memory.'),
(42, 'Thought deceleration', 'Cognitive', 'Thought deceleration (also known as bradyphrenia) is the process of thought being slowed down significantly in comparison to that of normal sobriety. When experiencing this effect, it will feel as if the time it takes to think a thought and the amount of time which occurs between each thought has been slowed down to the point of greatly impairing cognitive processes. It can manifest itself in delayed recognition, slower reaction times, and fine motor skills deficits.'),
(43, 'Pupil dilation', 'Physical', 'Pupil dilation (also called mydriasis) can be described as the enlargement of the size of a person\'s pupils under normal lighting conditions. Normally, the pupil size increases in the dark and shrinks in the light, however, a dilated pupil will remain excessively large even in a bright environment.'),
(44, 'Increased heart rate', 'Physical', 'Increased heart rate or tachycardia is described as a heart rate that is faster than the normal heart rate at rest. The average healthy human heart normally beats 60 to 100 times a minute when a person is at rest. When the heart rate fluctuates to higher levels over 100 BPM, it is described as tachychardia or an abnormally high heart rate.'),
(45, 'Spatial disorientation', 'Physical', 'Spatial disorientation is defined as the failure to perceive or perceiving incorrectly the position, motion, or altitude of oneself within the fixed coordinate system provided by the surface of the Earth and the gravitational vertical. In this state, a person may have trouble distinguishing up from down, right from left, or any two different directions from another. The person might also perceive the world or their own body as being flipped sideways or upside down.'),
(46, 'Mindfulness', 'Cognitive', 'Mindfulness can be described as a psychological concept which is well established within the scientific literature and commonly discussed in association with meditation. It is often broken down into two separate subcomponents which comprise this effect: The first of these components involves the self-regulation of attention so that its focus is completely directed towards immediate experience, thereby quietening one\'s internal narrative and allowing for increased recognition of external and mental events within the present moment. The second of these components involves adopting a particular orientation toward one?s experiences in the present moment that is characterized by a lack of judgement, curiosity, openness, and acceptance.'),
(47, 'Multiple thought streams', 'Cognitive', 'Multiple thought streams is a state of mind in which a person has more than one internal narrative or stream of consciousness simultaneously occurring within their head. This can result in any number of independent thought streams occurring at the same time, each of which are often controllable in a similar manner to that of one\'s everyday thought stream.'),
(48, 'Rejuvenation', 'Cognitive', 'Rejuvenation can be described as feelings of mild to extreme cognitive refreshment which are felt during the afterglow of certain compounds. The symptoms of rejuvenation often include a sustained sense of heightened mental clarity, increased emotional stability, increased calmness, mindfulness, increased motivation, personal bias suppression, increased focus and decreased depression. At its highest level, feelings of rejuvenation can become so intense that they manifest as the profound and overwhelming sensation of being \"reborn\" anew. This mindstate can potentially last anywhere from several hours to several months after the substance has worn off.'),
(49, 'Stimulation', 'Physical', 'Stimulation can be described as an increase in a person\'s physical energy levels which are interpreted as encouraging when it comes to wakefulness, movement, performing tasks, talkativeness, and general exercise.'),
(50, 'Appetite suppression', 'Physical', 'Appetite suppression can be described as the experience of a distinct decrease in a person\'s sense of hunger and appetite in a manner which can result in both a lesser desire to eat food and a decreased enjoyment of its taste. This typically results in the person undergoing prolonged periods of time without eating food.'),
(51, 'Dehydration', 'Physical', 'Dehydration can be described as an uncomfortably dry mouth and feelings of general thirstiness that results due to a lack of water intake. Untreated dehydration generally results in delirium, unconsciousness, swelling of the tongue, and (in extreme cases) death. The formal definition of dehydration is defined as an excessive loss of body water within a living organism which results in an accompanying disruption of metabolic processes.'),
(52, 'Nausea', 'Physical', 'Nausea can be described as a sensation of unease and discomfort in the upper stomach combined with an involuntary urge to vomit. It often, but not always, precedes vomiting. This effect usually occurs at the onset of the experience and dissipates as the peak takes its toll.'),
(53, 'Time distortion', 'Cognitive', 'Time distortion is an effect that makes the passage of time feel difficult to keep track of and wildly distorted. It is usually felt in two different forms, time dilation and time compression.'),
(54, 'Difficulty urinating', 'Physical', 'Difficulty urinating also known as urinary retention, can be described as the experience of a decreased ability to pass urine. This can be due to painful burning sensations within the urethra or a due to a loss of bladder control which prevents or inhibits one from urinating even with a full bladder.'),
(55, 'Tactile enhancement', 'Physical', 'Tactile enhancement is an overall increase in both the intensity of a person\'s sense of touch and their awareness of the physical sensations across their body. At its highest level, this becomes extreme enough that the exact location and current sensation of every single nerve ending across one\'s skin can be felt and comprehended all at once. In contrast, throughout normal sober living, most people can only maintain awareness of the tactile sensations which are relevant to their current situation.'),
(56, 'Increased bodily temperature', 'Physical', 'Increased bodily temperature or pyrexia can be described as having a body temperature which is above normal baseline. While there is no universally agreed upon value at which pyrexia occurs, its diagnoses ranges between 37.5 - 38.3?C (99.5 - 100.9?F). For comparison, the average temperature of a healthy person is around 37?C (98.6?F). It is worth noting that a bodily temperature which exceeds 41.5?C (106.7?F) is an emergency which requires immediate medical attention and can potentially result in physical injury, long-term side effects, and death.'),
(57, 'Bodily control enhancement', 'Physical', 'Bodily control enhancement can be described as feeling as if there has been a distinct increase in a person\'s ability to control their physical body with precision, balance, coordination, and dexterity. This results in the feeling that they can accurately control a much greater variety of muscles across their body with the tiniest of subtle mental triggers.'),
(58, 'Conceptual thinking', 'Cognitive', 'Conceptual thinking is an alteration to the nature and content of one\'s internal thought stream. This alteration predisposes a user to think thoughts which are no longer primarily comprised of words and linear sentence structures. Instead, thoughts become equally comprised of what is perceived to be incredibly detailed renditions of the innately understandable and internally stored concepts for which no words exist. Thoughts cease to be spoken by an internal narrator and are instead ?felt? and intuitively understood.'),
(59, 'Introspection', 'Cognitive', 'Introspection can be described as the experience of a state of mind in which a person feels as if they are being encouraged or forced to reflect upon and examine aspects of their life, thoughts, and feelings.'),
(60, 'Personal bias suppression', 'Cognitive', 'Personal bias suppression (also called cultural filter suppression) is a decrease in the personal or cultural biases, preferences, and associations which a person knowingly or unknowingly filters and interprets their perception of the world through.'),
(61, 'Creativity enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Creativity enhancement is a perceived increase in one\'s capability to imagine new ideas, create art, or think about existing concepts in a novel manner. This effect is particularly useful to artists of any sort as it can help a person overcome creative blocks on existing projects and induce inspiration for entirely new projects. Creativity enhancement can make imaginative activities more enjoyable and effortless in the moment and the inspiration from it can benefit the individual even after the effect has worn off.'),
(62, 'Immersion enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Immersion enhancement is an effect which results in a pronounced increase in one\'s tendency to become fully captivated and engrossed by external stimuli such as film, TV shows, video games, and various other forms of media. This greatly increases one\'s suspension of disbelief, increases one?s empathy with the characters, suppresses one\'s memory of the \"outside world\", and allows one to become engaged on a level that is largely unattainable during everyday sober living.'),
(63, 'Emotion enhancement', 'Cognitive', 'Emotion enhancement is an effect which greatly amplifies and enhances a person\'s current emotional state beyond normal levels of intensity.'),
(64, 'Dry mouth', 'Physical', 'Dry mouth (formally known as xerostomia) can be described as having a dry-feeling mouth often accompanied by a difficulty swallowing. It is usually a direct result of dehydration but can be felt to occur regardless of the actual dryness of a person\'s mouth.'),
(65, 'Stamina enhancement', 'Physical', 'Stamina enhancement can be described as an increased ability to engage in physically and mentally taxing activities without the development of fatigue. Although this effect is commonly mistaken for stimulation, it differs as it is not a direct increase in one\'s energy levels. Instead, it is an increase in one\'s resilience in performing an activity combined with a mitigation of general fatigue.'),
(66, 'Teeth grinding', 'Physical', 'Teeth grinding (also known as bruxism, jaw clenching, and gurning) can be described as a compulsive and often uncontrollable urge to grind one\'s teeth. In extreme cases, this can result in painful damage to one\'s tongue, teeth and inner cheek.'),
(67, 'Emotion suppression', 'Cognitive', 'Emotion suppression (also known as flat affect, apathy, or emotional blunting) is a flattening or decrease in the intensity of one\'s current emotional state below normal levels.'),
(68, 'Psychosis', 'Cognitive', 'Psychosis is as an abnormal condition of the mind and a general psychiatric term for a mental state in which one experiences a \"loss of contact with reality.\"'),
(69, 'Sedation', 'Physical', 'Sedation can be described as a decrease in a person\'s physical energy levels which are interpreted as discouraging when it comes to wakefulness, movement, performing tasks, talkativeness, and general exercise. At lower levels, sedation typically results in feelings of general relaxation and a loss of energy. At higher levels, however, sedation typically results in the person passing out into temporary unconsciousness.'),
(70, 'Appetite enhancement', 'Physical', 'Appetite enhancement (also known as \"the munchies\") can be described as the experience of a distinct increase in a person\'s sense of hunger and appetite. This results in both an increased desire to eat food and an increased enjoyment of its taste.'),
(71, 'Focus suppression', 'Cognitive', 'Focus suppression (also known as distractability) is a decreased ability to selectively concentrate on an aspect of the environment while ignoring other things.'),
(72, 'Paranoia', 'Cognitive', 'Paranoia is the suspiciousness or the belief that one is being harassed, persecuted, or unfairly treated. These feelings can range from subtle and ignorable to intense and overwhelming enough to trigger panic attacks and feelings of impending doom.'),
(73, 'Pain relief', 'Physical', 'Pain relief can be described as an effect which suppresses negative sensations such as aches and pains. '),
(74, 'Muscle relaxation', 'Physical', 'Muscle relaxation can be described as the experience of muscles losing their rigidity or tenseness while becoming relaxed and comfortable. '),
(75, 'Respiratory depression', 'Physical', 'Respiratory depression (also known as hypoventilation) can be described as a reduced urge to breathe that can be fatal depending on its intensity.'),
(76, 'Disinhibition', 'Cognitive', 'Disinhibition is an orientation towards immediate gratification, leading to impulsive behavior driven by current thoughts, feelings, and external stimuli, without regard for past learning or consideration of future consequences.'),
(77, 'Irritability', 'Cognitive', 'Irritability is the pervasive and sustained emotional state of being easily annoyed and provoked to anger.'),
(78, 'Language suppression', 'Cognitive', 'Language suppression (also known as aphasia) is the decreased ability to use and understand speech. This creates the feeling of finding it difficult or even impossible to vocalize one\'s own thoughts and to process the speech of others.'),
(79, 'Sleepiness', 'Cognitive', 'Sleepiness (also known as drowsiness) is a state of near-sleep, or a strong desire for sleep without feeling a decrease in one\'s physical energy levels.'),
(80, 'Cough suppression', 'Physical', 'Cough suppression can be described as a decreased desire and need to cough.'),
(81, 'Itchiness', 'Physical', 'Itchiness is the sensation that causes a person the desire or reflex to scratch at their skin. At lower levels, itchiness can occur as a subtle and minor annoyance which is easy to ignore.'),

(1, 'DMT', 'N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (also known as DMT and \"The Spirit Molecule\") is a naturally-occurring psychedelic substance of the tryptamine class that produces uniquely powerful and short-lived psychedelic effects when administered.\r\n\r\nDepending on the dosage and method of administration, the effects of DMT can range from mild psychedelic states to powerfully immersive life-altering experiences which are often described as the ultimate displacement from ordinary consciousness in which users are placed in a subjective state where they can experience exploring ineffable spiritual realms or alternate dimensions.\r\n\r\nDMT is present in over 65 species of plants and has been identified as being a normal constituent of human metabolism and an endogenous neurotransmitter in certain rodents. Its presence is also known to be widespread throughout the plant kingdom. Although various theories have been postulated, its neurobiological function has yet to be determined.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, DMT is known as an extremely powerful visionary psychedelic entheogen that, when vaporized or smoked, produces short-lived effects with a very rapid onset that is sometimes described as an \"impossibly high-speed rollercoaster ride.\" When ingested in combination with a MAOI or RIMA agent, it becomes active orally and significantly longer lasting, immersive, and interactive in nature: this combination is known as ayahuasca. Ayahuasca brews have been used traditionally in South America since at least around the year 1500.\r\n\r\nUnlike most highly prohibited substances, DMT is not considered to be addictive or toxic by the scientific community. Nevertheless, unpredictable adverse reactions such as uncontrollable anxiety, delusions and psychosis can always occur, particularly among those predisposed to mental disorders. While these negative reactions or \"bad trips\" can often be attributed to user inexperience or improper preparation of set and setting, they have been known to happen spontaneously among even highly experienced users as well. It is therefore highly advised to approach this incredibly powerful and unpredictable hallucinogenic substance with the proper preparation and harm reduction practices if using it.', 'DMT\'s psychedelic effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, N,N-dimethyltrytamine is believed to be an endogenous ligand for the sigma receptor. However, the significance of the sigma-1 receptor remains the subject of ongoing scientific research.\r', 'DMT, or N,N-dimethyltryptamine, is a naturally-occurring indole alkaloid molecule of the tryptamine class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. DMT contains two methyl groups (CH3-) bound to the terminal amine RN at the end of this chain.

(2, 'Cannabis', 'Cannabis (also known as marijuana, weed, pot,, grass, herb, and many others) is a preparation of the cannabis plant that produces psychoactive effects. The principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which makes up one of 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 84 other cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and cannabigerol (CBG).\r\n\r\nThe genus cannabis is indigenous to central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The earliest recorded uses of cannabis date from the 3rd millennium BC. At least three species are recognized: Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis. In modern times, cannabis is used for recreational or medicinal and religious or spiritual purposes.\r\n\r\nSince the early 20th century, cannabis has been subject to legal restrictions with the possession, use, and sale of cannabis preparations containing psychoactive cannabinoids currently illegal in most countries of the world. According to a United Nations report, cannabis is the most used illicit drug in the world. In 2004, the U.N. estimated that global consumption patterns of cannabis indicated that approximately 4% of the adult world population (162 million people) used cannabis annually and that approximately 0.6% (22.5 million) of people used cannabis daily.\r\n\r\n', 'The most psychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis plant is tetrahydrocannabinol (or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), commonly known as THC. Other cannabinoids include delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromene (CBC) and cannabigerol (CBG); they have less psychotropic effects than THC, but may play a role in the overall effect of cannabis. The most studied are THC, CBD and CBN. The entourage effect is a proposed mechanism by which compounds present in cannabis which are largely non-psychoactive by themselves modulate the overall psychoactive effects of the plant (these resulting principally from the action of the main psychoactive component of cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)).\r\n\r\nTHC appears to alter mood and cognition through its agonist actions on the CB1 receptors, which inhibit a secondary messenger system (adenylate cyclase) in a dose dependent manner. Via CB1 activation, THC indirectly increases dopamine release and produces psychotropic effects. Cannabidiol acts as an allosteric modulator of the mu and delta opioid receptors. THC also potentiates the effects of the glycine receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the cannabis high remains subject to on-going scientific investigation.', 'Cannabis plants contain a number of different specific compounds at various ratios. Cannabis contains more than 460 compounds; at least 80 of these are cannabinoids, chemical compounds that interact with cannabinoid receptors in the brain.

(3, 'Amphetamine', 'Amphetamine (also known as alpha-methylphenethylamine and speed) is a stimulant substance of the phenethylamine class. It is the parent compound of the substituted amphetamines, a group which includes a diverse range of substances like bupropion, phenmetrazine, MDMA, and DOx. Amphetamine acts primarily by enhancing the activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain.\r\n\r\nAmphetamine was first synthesized in 1887. In the 1930s, it began to be marketed and sold over-the-counter under the name Benzedrine. It was widely used to treat a wide range of ailments such as alcohol hangover, narcolepsy, depression, and weight reduction. Today, amphetamine is prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity. Additionally, it sees widespread illicit use as a performance enhancing agent and recreational substance.\r\n\r\nAmphetamine is viewed as one of the benchmark members of the stimulant class. Characteristic effects include stimulation, enhanced focus, increased libido, suppressed appetite, and euphoria. It is usually taken orally, but can also be insufflated, injected, or administered rectally. Lower doses are commonly reported to increase focus and productivity while higher doses tend to increase sociability, sexual desire, and euphoria.\r\n\r\nRecreational use of amphetamine is associated with dependence and abuse. It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance.\r\n\r\n', 'Amphetamine exerts its behavioral effects by increasing the signaling activity of neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine in the reward and executive function pathways of the brain. The reinforcing and motivational effects of amphetamine are mostly due to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway. The euphoric and locomotor-stimulating effects of amphetamine are dependent upon the magnitude and speed by which it increases synaptic dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations in the striatum.\r\n\r\nAmphetamine is a potent full agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and interacts with vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Combined action on TAAR1 and VMAT2 results in increased concentrations of dopamine and norepinephrine in the synapses, which stimulates neuronal activity.\r\n\r\nDextroamphetamine is a more potent agonist of TAAR1 than levoamphetamine. Consequently, dextroamphetamine produces greater CNS stimulation than levoamphetamine, roughly three to four times more, but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects.\r\n\r\n', 'Amphetamine, also known as alpha-methylphenethylamine, is a synthetic substance of the phenethylamine family. The chemical structure of amphetamine consists of phenethylamine, a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain, with an additional methyl substitution at R?. The name \'amphetamine\' is a contraction from ?lphamethylphenethylamine\n\nAmphetamine is a chiral compound. The racemic mixture can be divided into two distinct enantiomers: levo- and dextro-amphetamine. Attention disorders are often treated using Adderall or a generic equivalent, a formulation of mixed amphetamine salts that contain both racemic-amphetamine, in the sulfate and aspartate monohydrate salt forms, and enantiopure dextroamphetamine, in the sulfate and saccharate salt forms, mixed to yield a final ratio of 3 parts dextroamphetamine to 1 part levoamphetamine.\n\nAt room temperature, the pure free base of amphetamine is a mobile, colorless, and volatile liquid with a characteristically strong amine odor, and acrid, burning taste.', '5-20mg', '20-70mg', '70mg+', 'Amphetamine.svg', '49,36,44,50,56,43,51,64,65,66,1,40,38,8,5,10,13,14,18,21,67,68,53'),
(4, 'Kratom', 'Mitragyna speciosa (also known as kratom) is a tropical tree of the coffee family indigenous to South East Asia. The leaves of M. speciosa contain various psychoactive alkaloids that produce mild stimulant and opioid effects. The pharmacology of kratom is complex, although it produces its major effects through action at opioid receptors in the brain.\r\n\r\nM. speciosa is indigenous to Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea, where it has been used in traditional medicines for centuries. Traditionally, fresh or dried kratom leaves are chewed or made into tea. Starting in the 2000s, kratom began to receive significant attention due to increased use in Western cultures as an alternative medicine. It is readily available for purchase from a large number of internet vendors, most commonly as dried and powdered leaves.\r\n\r\nUser reports indicate that the effects of kratom vary depending on the dose used. Lower doses are reported to produce a caffeine-like stimulant effect. Higher doses produce opioid effects like pain relief, sedation, and euphoria. Many users claim kratom is useful in treating opioid addiction as a weaning agent, particularly during the initial withdrawal phase. Kratom exists in a variety of strains with different characteristics, some more opioid-like than others.\r\n\r\nKratom\'s mood-elevating effects have raised concerns about the plant\'s potential for dependence and abuse. In some jurisdictions, its sale and importation have been restricted, and several public health authorities have raised alerts. Strong evidence for its claimed benefits are lacking. It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance.', 'Kratom behaves as an opioid receptor agonist similar in function to morphine and other opiates, although its pharmacological action and subjective effects differ significantly from those of traditional opiates.\r\n\r\nOpioids exert their effects by binding to and activating the opioid receptors. They structurally mimic endogenous endorphins which are naturally found within the body and also work upon the opioid receptor system. The way in which opioids structurally mimic these natural endorphins results in their euphoric, pain-relieving and anxiolytic effects. This is because endorphins are responsible for reducing pain, causing sedation, and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or general excitement.\r\n\r\nMitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine bind as partial agonists to the mu-opioid receptors and antagonistic to the kappa and delta-opioid receptors. They have high binding affinities to the mu and kappa-receptors. The binding affinity to the delta-receptors is high for 7-hydroxymitragynine, but weak for mitragynine.\r\n\r\nUnlike most other opioids, kratom also presents affinity for the ?-opioid, norepinephrine and serotonin receptor systems where it functions as an agonist. Its action on norepinephrine and serotonin also likely contributes to kratom\'s stimulating properties.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, kratom contains alkaloids (rhynchophylline and mitraphylline) which function as NMDA receptor antagonists. This may be responsible for the mild dissociating effects which occur at heavy doses.', 'The leaves of M. speciosa contain more than 40 compounds, including many indole alkaloids such as mitragynine, mitraphylline, and 7-hydroxymitragynine (which is currently the most likely candidate for the primary active chemical in the plant). Other active compounds in M. speciosa include raubasine, rhynchophylline, and corynantheidine, among many others.\r\n\r\nThe amount of active alkaloids in the leaves highly depends on many factors. One major factor is the location of the tree.

(5, 'LSD', 'Lysergic acid diethylamide (also known as Lysergide, LSD-25, LSD, L, lucy, and acid) is a semisynthetic psychedelic substance of the lysergamide class. LSD is one of the most potent, well-known and widely used psychedelic substances. The pharmacology of LSD is complex, but it acts primarily by stimulating serotonin receptors in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe psychoactive effects of LSD were first discovered in 1943 by the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann. In the 1950s, LSD was marketed under the trade name Delysid and used in psychotherapy and for experimental purposes. LSD garnered widespread interest from clinicians and researchers and was secretly investigated by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a potential mind control agent. During the mid-1960s, use of LSD spread widely in the emerging counterculture, leading to its prohibition in 1971.\r\n\r\nFollowing a 40 year hiatus, research into LSD\'s potential therapeutic uses has been revived. LSD is currently under investigation for the treatment of a number of ailments including alcoholism, addiction, cluster headache, and anxiety associated with terminal illness. LSD remains in widespread illicit use for recreational and spiritual purposes. The lifetime prevalence of LSD use among adults is in the range of 6-8%.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic effects of LSD include geometric visual hallucinations, time distortion, enhanced introspection, and ego loss. LSD is commonly described by users to evoke entheogenic and mystical-type experiences that can facilitate self-reflection and personal growth. It is considered by some to be the first modern entheogen, a category which had been limited to traditional plant preparations or extracts.\r\n\r\nUnlike other highly prohibited substances, LSD is not considered to be addictive or physiologically toxic. Nevertheless, adverse psychological reactions such as severe anxiety, paranoia and psychosis are always possible, particularly among those predisposed to mental illness. It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices if using this substance.', 'LSD acts as a partial agonist for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C and 5-HT6 receptors. LSD binds to most serotonin receptor subtypes except for 5-HT3 and 5-HT4. 5-HT5B receptors, which have not been found in humans, also have a high affinity for LSD. The psychedelic effects LSD are thought to be mediated by agonist action 5-HT2A receptors.\r\n\r\nLSD also possesses efficacy at all dopamine and all norepinephrine receptors. Most serotonergic psychedelics are not significantly dopaminergic, so LSD is unique in this respect. LSD\'s agonism of D2 receptors has been shown to contribute to its psychoactive effects.\r\n', 'LSD, or d-lysergic acid diethylamide, is a semisynthetic substance of the lysergamide family.

It is commonly used to enhance cognition, reduce fatigue, and increase alertness in both medical and non-medical contexts.\r\n\r\nModafinil is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, shift work sleep disorder and narcolepsy. However, studies have shown that modafinil may also be useful off-label for alleviating the symptoms of depression,, bipolar disorder, Parkinson\'s disease, seasonal depressive disorder, ADHD, and various other conditions which have fatigue as a symptom.\r\n\r\nModafinil has also been used as a doping agent by various athletes due to its ability to produce physical stimulation. It has recently gained mainstream popularity for its use as a \"smart drug\" to improve memory, counteract the desire or need for sleep, and increase general productivity.', 'Although the exact mechanisms by which modafinil and its R-enantiomer, armodafinil, decrease sleepiness are not fully understood, evidence suggests that these agents promote wakefulness by acting directly or indirectly on many components of the sleep / wake circuit. Modafinil and armodafinil are hypothesized to inhibit GABA and promote dopamine, norepinephrine, histamine, and hypocretin / orexin.\r\n\r\nModafinil and its R-enantiomer, armodafinil, increase both norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), possibly via their blockade of both the NE and DA reuptake transporters (NET and DAT, respectively). The actions of NE at alpha-adrenergic receptors and DA at dopamine D2 receptors are thought to contribute to the wake-promoting properties of modafinil. Orexin is a key component of the arousal system; thus, the hypothesized action of modafinil on the orexinergic system may help increase alertness. Additionally, modafinil may indirectly increase histamine, either by reducing GABAergic inhibition of histaminergic neurons or via actions at orexinergic neurons. The increase in histamine may contribute to both the wake-promoting effects of modafinil as well as the potential of modafinil to increase alertness.\r\n\r\nIn genetically engineered mice lacking the dopamine transporter (DAT), modafinil lacked wake-promoting activity, suggesting that this activity was DAT-dependent. However, the wake-promoting effects of modafinil, unlike those of amphetamine, were not reduced by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol in rats. In addition, alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis, blocks the action of amphetamine but does not block locomotor activity induced by modafinil.', 'Modafinil is a synthetic molecule of the benzhydryl class. Benzhydryl compounds are comprised of two benzene rings attached to a single carbon molecule. Modafinil is classified as a sulphinyl benzhydryl molecule, as it also contains a sulphinyl group, a sulphur molecule double-bonded to an oxygen molecule, attached to the carbon of the benzhydryl group. From this sulphur group at R2, an acetamide group is bound at its free carbon through a carbonyl group to a terminal amine group. Modafinil is structurally analogous to fluorafinil, another benzhydryl stimulant.\r\n\r\nWhile modafinil is a racemic mixture, a similar medication, armodafinil, consists of only the (âˆ’)-(R)-enantiomer of modafinil.', '25 - 100 mg', '100 - 200 mg', '100 - 300+ mg', 'Modafinil.png', '44,31,49,43,30,50,51,52,21,8,18,13,14,53,10'),

Alcoholic beverages are divided into three classes: beers, wines, and spirits (distilled beverages).\r\n\r\nAlcohol is legally consumed in most countries around the world. More than 100 countries have laws regulating their production, sale, and consumption. Alcohol is historically one of the oldest and most widely used psychoactive substances and continues to be the most widely used recreational substance to date. Alcoholic beverages have been produced and consumed by humans since the Neolithic Era, from hunter-gatherer communities to nation-states. Also, drinking alcohol is one of the most commonly abused drugs in the world (Meropol, 1996).', 'Ethanol in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes alcohol intoxication (drunkenness), stupor, unconsciousness, and generalized depression of central nervous system function. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism.\r\n\r\nAlcohol can be addictive to humans, and can result in alcohol tolerance, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, drug dependence or alcoholism. It has a number of adverse effects on health. The drug has been adjudged to be neurotoxic when consumed in sufficient quantities. In high doses or overdose, alcohol may cause loss of consciousness or, in severe cases, death. It is a causative factor for many traffic accidents and fatalities due to intoxicated driving.\r\n\r\nIn the past, alcohol was believed to be a non-specific pharmacological agent affecting many neurotransmitter systems in the brain. However, molecular pharmacology studies have shown that alcohol has only a few primary targets. These effects are facilitatory in some systems and inhibitory in others.\r\n\r\nAmong the neurotransmitter systems with enhanced functions are:\r\n\r\nGABA: In a fashion similar to benzodiazepines, an enhancement of the inhibitory system known as GABA induces neurological inhibition. This depresses the behavioral inhibitory centers, slows down the processing of information from the senses, inhibits thought processes and generally induces a suppression of both normal physical and cognitive functioning.\r\n5-HT3 receptor agonism\r\nNicotinic acetylcholine receptors\r\nAmong those that are inhibited are:\r\n\r\nGlutamate: By making this excitatory neurotransmitter less effective, neurological functioning is further inhibited. Alcohol does this by interacting with the receptors on the receiving cells in these pathways and blocking glutamate from binding to NMDA receptors and triggering electrochemical signals.\r\nDihydropyridine\r\nThe result of these direct effects is a wave of further indirect effects involving a variety of other neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems, leading finally to the behavioural or symptomatic effects of alcohol intoxication. It\'s worth noting, however, that in terms of how these processes directly result in the subjective experience of ethanol intoxication, the exact mechanisms are still largely unknown beyond speculation.', 'Ethanol (Ethyl alcohol) is the second simplest compound of the alcohol family.

In the 19th century, it was discovered to have anesthetic properties which made it suitable for dental and surgical procedures. It was given the name \"laughing gas\" by the British chemist Humphry Davy due to its exhilarating and laughter-inducing effects. The recreational use of nitrous has its origins in \"laughing gas parties\" which were held to demonstrate these properties to Davy\'s friends.\r\n\r\nToday, nitrous oxide is widely used in surgery and dentistry for its anaesthetic and analgesic effects. It is on the World Health Organization\'s List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is also sold as a whipped cream propellant in kitchen and household stores.\r\n\r\nNitrous is considered to have low toxicity when used in moderation. However, chronic use can cause vitamin B12 depletion, which may lead to severe nerve damage. Additionally, improper use puts the user at risk of oxygen deprivation.', 'Although N2O affects quite a few receptors, its anesthetic, hallucinogenic, and euphoriant effects are likely caused predominantly or fully via its effects as an NMDA receptor antagonist. NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually the famous â€œholeâ€.\r\n\r\nThe pharmacological mechanism of action behind N2O in medicine is not entirely known. However, it has been shown to directly modulate a broad range of receptors and this likely plays a significant role in many of its effects. It moderately blocks Î²2-subunit-containing nACh channels, weakly inhibits AMPA, kainate, GABAC, and 5-HT3 receptors and slightly potentiates GABAA and glycine receptors. It has also been shown to activate two-pore-domain K+ channels.', 'Nitrous oxide, or dinitrogen monoxide, was first synthesised by heating ammonium nitrate in the presence of iron filings and then passing the gas that came off (NO) through water.
